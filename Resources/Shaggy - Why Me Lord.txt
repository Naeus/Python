Huh
No, its me sing sometime
As soon as people reach in a
Bad situation they start to call on God
Ha haa haa
You should remember God in your everyday nuance
Not just when it gets bad you know what it is
Shaggy

Early Sunday morning in the spring of ninety-six
I'm chilling on my couch watching the Bulls against the Knicks
My honey marches in and asks me if I think I'm slick
It seem she found my shirt with lipstick
I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick
Incriminating pictures showing me some other chick
It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
She asked me if I can spell the word evict

(Why me Lord?)
Situation looking kinda bad
(Why me Lord?)
I lost the best girl I ever had
(Why me Lord?)
I'm homeless and I'm feelin' kinda sad
(Why me? Why me? Why me?)
Why me? Why me, Lord?
(How you 'member massa God so quick?)
Why me, Lord?
(When trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit)
Why me, Lord?
(Is just because you don't know when to quit?)
Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me?

(Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me? Why me, Lord?)
(Why me? Why me Lord? Why me?)
Why me? Why me? Why me?
(Why me? Why me Lord? Why me? Why me, Lord?)
(Why me? Why me Lord? Why me?)
Why me? Why me? Why me?

Just the other day when I was rolling with my crew
Made a little flex around by Flatbush avenue
Calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
That's when I saw the boys in blue

They pulled me to the side why I don't even have a clue
An' looking for a reason and they finally found a few
A case of ammunition with a loaded thirty two
I can't believe what I'm going through

Why me, Lord?
(Here I am, I gotta face the time)
Why me, Lord?
(Though the evidence ain't even mine)
Why me, Lord?
(I swear, I ain't guilty of the crime)
(Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me?)
Why me? Why me? Why me, Lord?
(How you 'member massa god so quick?)
Why me, Lord?
(When trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit)
Why me, Lord?
(Is just because you don't know when to quit?)
Why me? Why me? Why me? Why me?

(Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me? Why me, Lord?)
(Why me, Lord? Why me?)
Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me? Why me?
(Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me? Why me, Lord?)
Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me? Why me?

Take heed never take advantage of the things you need
Never let yourself be over come by greed
Walk the straight and narrow and you shall succeed
Get your act up to speed
And try no matter what it takes to give a next man a blye
Everybody else deserve a piece o' the pie
Honesty the best policy no sell no samfie
You no need fi ta ask why

(Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me?)
(Why me, Lord? Why me?)
Why me? Why me? Why me?
(Why me? Why me, Lord? Why me? Why me, Lord?)
(Why me, Lord? Why me?)
Why me? Why me? Why me
